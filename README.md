# puppet-puppet

This is a small puppet module to configure Puppet. It is roughly based on the [puppetlabs-operations](http://github.com/puppetlabs-operations/puppet-puppet) module.

It is *very* site-specific and is not really mean for widespread use.

It also requires some of my other modules:

* [nginx](https://github.com/jtopjian/puppet-nginx)
* [unicorn](https://github.com/jtopjian/puppet-unicorn)
